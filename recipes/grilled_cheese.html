    <p>
        <h4><ul>
            <li>2 slices sourdough bread</li>
            <li>2 tbsp SALTED butter </li>
            <li>1/3 cup (heaped) vintage cheddar cheese or gruyere</li>
            <li>1/3 cup mozzarella</li>
        </ul></h4>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
    </p>
    <p>
        <h4><ol>
            <li>Butter Bread</li>
                <p>Slather both sides of each piece of bread with the butter (yes, all 4 sides!).</p>

            <li>Light Toast</li>
                <p>Heat a heavy-based skillet or frying pan over medium low heat 
                (no oil or butter). Place both pieces of bread in the skillet and 
                lightly toast for 1 minute to warm it through and create a light 
                crust. (When we flip, this gives the cheese a head start).
                </p>

            <li>Pile on Cheese</li>
                <p>Flip one slice of bread, then pile on the cheddar cheese 
                followed by the mozzarella. Place the other slice of bread 
                on top, with the hot toasted side in contact with the cheese.
                </p>
            
            <li>Cook 3 Minutes</li>
                <p>Cook for 3 minutes or until the bread is evenly golden 
                    and crisp, pressing down lightly with a spatula every 
                    now and then. If it's browning too quickly, remove remove 
                    from the stove to cool down a bit and lower heat.
                </p>

            <li>Flip 3 Minutes</li>
                <p>Turn the sandwich over, and cook the other side for 3 
                minutes or until the bread is golden and the cheese is melted.
                </p>
                
            <li>Devour</li>
                <p>Transfer to cutting board. Cut in half in one swift motion. 
                Admire cheese pull. Devour.
