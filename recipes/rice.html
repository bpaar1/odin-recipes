            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>3 to 4 cups low-sodium chicken broth</li>
            <li>Juice of 3 limes and zest of 2 limes (hold back juice of 1 lime for garnish)</li>

    <p>
        <h4><ol>
            <li>Cook the Rice</li>
                <p>Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic
                and onions and cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Reduce the heat to low and 
                add the rice and salt. Cook over a low heat for 3 minutes, stirring 
                constantly to make sure the rice doesn't burn. Add 2 cups of the broth 
                and the juice and zest of 2 limes and bring it to a boil. Reduce the heat 
                to low, cover and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes or until the rice is done. 
                Add more liquid as needed. The rice shouldn't be sticky. 
                </p>

            <li>Add the Other Stuff</li>
                <p>Just before serving, stir through the juice of 1 lime and 
                    lots of chopped cilantro.</p>
